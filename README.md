# About Outpost 31

Outpost31 contains the core and module functionality for the [Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen) web service.

## About this repository

This repository is for the *development* version of Outpost31.

Since Outpost 31 technically doesn't do anything on it's own, there isn't a "stable" release aside from what is included in the stable release of Tingen.

This repository is public because I think it's important to make the source code available so everyone can poke through it, but it's not intended to be used on it's own.

## About the repository branches

There are three type of branches in this repository:

* [main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31)  
  This is about as "stable" as Outpost31 is going to get, and is the version that is included in the same version number of Tingen.

  For example, ***Release 24.7*** *of Tingen* includes ***Release 24.7*** **of Outpost31**

  The `main` version is occasionally merged with `development` for testing/documentation purposes.

* [development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31/tree/development)  
  The majority of Outpost31 development is done in this branch.
